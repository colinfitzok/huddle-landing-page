### What I learned

This was my first time working with: responsive background images that fill the viewport and Font Awesome icons. Technically, I have worked with both on FreeCodeCamp, but this was my first time working with them independently, without a project guide telling me what to do. I'm very happy with the end result, although I'm sure there's more I could do for a cleaner look on the icons. I also took more time to hone my markup into something that's cleaner, but there's still work to be done.

### Continued development

I want to continue working with making images responsive, as it can be quite finicky, and of course gaining more and more experience working with flexbox until it becomes second nature.
